## R Markdown

* flexible type of document that allows you combine 
executable R code, and its output, with text in a single document. 
* can be readily converted to multiple static and dynamic output
formats, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), and HTML (.html).
* The benefit of a well-prepared R Markdown document is full reproducibility. 
* you notice a data transcription error, or you are able to
add more data to your analysis, you will be able to recompile the report without making any changes in the actual document.
* The **rmarkdown** package comes pre-installed with RStudio, so no action is  necessary.
